Feature: Filter courses according to their defining traits, such as their course number, a recurring student, or a certain semester, 
and sort courses in terms of their relevance.

As a professor,
So I can more quickly recollect previous courses Iâ€™ve taught
I want to be able to filter and sort my courses.
